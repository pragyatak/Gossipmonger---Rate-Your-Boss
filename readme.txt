Use client-side JavaScript, AJAX, and Horizon  to build one of the applications listed below.  You may use any available third-party Web Service APIs, libraries, or modules, provided that you comply with the terms of their licenses.
Projects



Functionality
Note that project descriptions are very brief and deliberately underspecified.  This is your chance for creativity.  Begin with a set of possible features, plan according to the available time, and build something interesting.  Think of the project not as a finished application, but as a proof-of-concept, prototype, or Minimum Viable Product.
Working with other teams
You may discuss your project and the technologies you are using with other teams, but each team must build its own application and submit its own work.
Working with members of your team
In general, each student in a group will receive the same grade.  If you run into issues with your teammates, it is your responsibility to attempt to resolve them.
If you are unable to work with a member of your team (for example, if they disappear and fail to respond to attempts to contact them), bring the problem to my attention as soon as possible -- do not wait until the due date.
Presentations
On presentation day, give a short demonstration of your application to the class.  Include both functionality and implementation details.  Your entire team must be present and available to answer questions, but you may designate individual team members to deliver the presentation.
Grading
Each of the following factors contributes up to 3 points to the final grade for the project:
Quality of the presentation
Completeness of the presentation
Quality of documentation for installation and configuration
Quality of documentation for users
Project functionality
Project scope
Code quality
Code maintainability
Appropriate use of available technologies
Innovation
Web design
Teamwork
